# my-class
sistem per menaxhimin e klases
The My Class project is a web app that works in two forms, the first form is that a teacher can register and create his virtual classroom with his students. In each class the teacher can define tasks, teaching schedules, can create announcements, drop student grades and much more. The second form is that the student can be identified in the application using the data provided by his teacher. The student can view his grades, read announcements, be informed on schedule etc.
